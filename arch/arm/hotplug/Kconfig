config ZEN_DECISION
	bool "Zen Decision: MSM Userspace Handler"
	depends on SMP && FB
	default n
	help
	  MSM/Qcomm devices have multiple userspace applications that handle
	  CPU hotplugging and frequency operations.

	  ZenDecision is a partial resolution to handling behavior caused by
	  disabling some of these services.

	  For example, If MPDecision is disabled and MSM-Thermal_Engine is 
	  enabled in the userspace. Situations where CPUs go offline but never
	  come back online occur.
  
	  ZenDecision ensures all CPUs are online when they are supposed to be by:
	  - Enable all CPUs when screen comes on after zen_wake_delay
	  - Ignore all CPU_UP operations when battery level is <= 15% to respect
	    the decision made by MSMThermal (which disables cores at <= 15% battery)

	  Thresholds and driver enable/disable for above values can be found in:
	  /sys/kernel/zen_decision

	  ZenDecision is not a direct replacement for any of the MSM userspace
	  services.

	  If unsure, say N.
